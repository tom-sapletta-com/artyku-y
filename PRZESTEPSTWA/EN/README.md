## Introduction

In the era of digitization and growing dependence on information technology, cybercrime has become one of the most serious challenges for countries worldwide. Europe, as a region with developed digital infrastructure, is not free from threats related to cyber attacks. This analysis presents the most common cybercrimes resulting in convictions in European countries, along with average financial penalties and prison sentence lengths, as well as data on law enforcement in this area.

## Alarming Trend: From Technical to Ideological Cybercrimes

Analysis of cybercrime data in Europe reveals an alarming trend: a gradual shift from prosecuting strictly technical crimes (such as financial fraud or data security breaches) towards penalizing online content and speech. Categories such as "hate speech", "harassment", or "online extremism" are increasingly becoming the basis for convictions, raising questions about the limits of state interference in digital freedom of speech.

Particularly alarming is the example of Russia, where "online extremism" - an extremely broad category - is the most common cybercrime resulting in convictions. In practice, this term often conceals criticism of authorities or political statements contrary to the official government line. Worrying is the fact that similar tendencies are beginning to be visible in other European countries, where concepts such as "hate speech" or "online harassment" do not always have clear and precise legal definitions.
