## Introduction

In the era of digitalization, cybercrime has become one of the most serious challenges for European countries. However, analysis of the latest data reveals a disturbing trend: a gradual shift from prosecuting purely technical crimes toward penalizing online content and expression.

As shown by data from 2025, categories such as "hate speech," "online harassment," or "online extremism" are increasingly becoming the basis for convictions in European countries. This raises a fundamental question: are cybersecurity regulations evolving into tools for controlling public discourse?

## Alarming Trend in European Cybersecurity

Analysis of data from individual European countries reveals that an increasing number of convictions relate to categories such as:

- **Hate speech** - a key category in France and Austria
- **Online harassment** - one of the three most common causes of sentences in Spain, the Czech Republic, Finland, and Hungary
- **Threats** - leading in Sweden and Norway
- **Online extremism** - the dominant reason for convictions in Russia

These categories are characterized by a lack of precise legal definitions, leaving considerable interpretative discretion to law enforcement and courts. While traditional cybercrimes (such as financial fraud or data breaches) typically have measurable effects and objective assessment criteria, "communication" offenses are much more subjective.

## Regional Differentiation with Disturbing Signals

| Region | Dominant Trends | Potential Threats |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Western Europe** | Growing number of hate speech and cyberbullying cases with significant financial penalties | Arbitrary interpretation of hate speech regulations |
| **Northern Europe** | High financial penalties for privacy violations, "threats" as a common category | Risk of overinterpretation of the concept of "threats" |
| **Eastern Europe** | The harshest sentences (up to 4.5 years) for "online extremism" | Model example of using regulations for political repression |
| **Southern Europe** | Traditional crimes dominate, but online harassment is gaining importance | Potential evolution toward a repressive model |
| **Central and Eastern Europe** | Growing percentage of harassment cases with consistently high penalties | Moving closer to the Eastern European model of content control |

## Disproportionality of Penalties and Selective Law Enforcement

An alarming signal is the disproportionality of penalties for different types of cybercrimes. In Russia, "online extremism" is punished with an average 4.5-year prison sentence, while financial fraud - causing measurable material damage - results in a much shorter deprivation of liberty.

The tendency to treat communication-related crimes more severely is also visible in EU countries. For example, in France, serious violations of hate speech regulations carry a penalty of up to 1.3 years in prison, with penalties of similar severity for financial fraud.

## Law Enforcement - Does the System Work?

Analysis of 2025 data shows significant differences in the effectiveness of law enforcement in the area of cybercrime:

- **Speed of action**: from 6-9 months in the United Kingdom to up to 18-24 months in Russia (time from report to verdict)
- **Amount of financial penalties**: up to â‚¬50 million in France for GDPR violations, but only a few thousand euros for content-related offenses
- **Imprisonment penalties**: the harshest in Russia (up to 5 years) and Romania (up to 3 years)

Importantly, the effectiveness of prosecuting "traditional" cybercrimes (such as fraud or ransomware attacks) remains at a relatively low level. According to a report by the European Court of Auditors, the effectiveness of detecting perpetrators of online financial fraud is only 23-38%, depending on the country.

At the same time, the effectiveness of prosecuting content-related crimes is increasing - in some countries, the detection rate for "hate speech" cases exceeds 70%. This disparity raises questions about the priorities of law enforcement systems.

## The Russian Experience as a Warning

The practice of applying "online extremism" regulations in Russia serves as an alarming example of how cybercrime regulations can be abused. In 2024, over 60% of all verdicts for online extremism concerned criticism of state institutions or publishing content inconsistent with the official narrative of the authorities.

Particularly concerning are:

- Long prison sentences (average 4.5 years)
- Arbitrariness in the interpretation of regulations
- Use of pre-trial detention as a form of punishment
- Disproportionality of sanctions in relation to the offense

The same legal mechanisms that officially serve to protect against hatred and violence online have, in practice, become a tool for controlling public discourse and suppressing opposition.

## Trends in the European Union - Which Direction Are We Heading?

The European Union consistently strives to harmonize cybercrime regulations. While a standardized approach has numerous advantages in fighting cross-border crime, warning signs are appearing:

1. **Capacious definitions** of communication offenses in European directives
2. **Emphasis on quick execution** at the expense of in-depth context analysis
3. **Increasing the powers** of law enforcement in the digital space
4. **Shifting responsibility** to internet platforms, which preventively remove content raising doubts

Recent proposals from the European Commission regarding combating disinformation and hate speech online are met with criticism from organizations defending digital rights, which point to the risk of excessive interference with freedom of expression.

## Recommendations for a Balanced Approach

Effective combating of cybercrime requires a balanced approach that protects citizens from real threats while respecting fundamental rights and freedoms:

1. **Precise definitions** of content-related offenses, limiting the field for arbitrary interpretations
2. **Independent judicial oversight** of law enforcement actions in the digital space
3. **Proportionality of penalties** - sanctions should correspond to the actual social harm
4. **Transparency of the process** and the possibility to appeal decisions on blocking content
5. **Prioritization** of prosecuting crimes causing measurable harm (such as fraud or ransomware attacks)

## Summary

Europe stands at a crossroads regarding the regulation of cyberspace. Data from 2025 shows a concerning trend of moving from protection against measurable technical threats toward control over public discourse.

The lesson from Russia should be a warning to us - it is easy to create a legal system that, under the guise of protection against cyber violence, becomes a tool for limiting basic civil liberties.

The challenge for European societies will be to develop a regulatory model that effectively protects against real threats while preserving space for free debate and exchange of views - including controversial ones. The future of European democracy in the digital age may depend on whether we succeed in this.
